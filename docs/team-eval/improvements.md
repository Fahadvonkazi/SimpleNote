The project team has several ideas for improving the website in the pipeline. Firstly, the website currently focuses on basic functionalities, and there is a possibility that important features needed for note-taking might be missing. It would be advisable to expand these features to increase the user base and usefulness of the app.

Furthermore, there is an opportunity to introduce collaborative work with other users. This would allow users to share their own notes with others and collaborate on them together.

Another improvement possibility would be to integrate earlier and adopt a more agile approach with sprints, rather than the current waterfall model. This would allow for the creation of a prototype sooner, rather than waiting until the last third of the project timeline. As a result, the frontend would have been completed earlier, despite the integration of the WYSIWYG editor, and more time would have been available to focus on implementing additional features such as note-saving.

Additionally, based on the results of our user evaluation, we could consider changing the color scheme to a darker one, as originally planned in our draft.
