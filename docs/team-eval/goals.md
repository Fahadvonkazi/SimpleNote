The project group essentially achieved all of its main goals set for the website. However, some minor objectives were not accomplished due to time constraints. These included adjustments to the color design and the integration of additional functionalities, also identified through the conducted user evaluation. The surveyed participants preferred a darker color scheme, particularly in the Notes-Page, which could not yet be implemented.

From a project management perspective, the project group initially aimed to hold weekly meetings, but this was not consistently followed, especially at the start, slightly delaying the workload. Nonetheless, Team SimpleNote met in person a total of six times and virtually via BBB multiple times throughout the project to collaborate on all aspects. As the overall workload decreased towards the end of the project due to the completion of other modules and sickness, we were able to dedicate more time to the project, resulting in increasingly productive meetings and successful coding. we were able to communicate effectively and smoothly, which was also one of our objectives.
