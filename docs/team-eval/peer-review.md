## Fahad von Kazi - review 1

### My observation
I found the teamwork within the team to be very pleasant. Initially, we planned weekly meetings, which we adhered to, but they declined midway through the semester, causing work to shift slightly behind schedule, requiring us to complete more work in a shorter time. We initially met virtually via BBB but then realized that it was most sensible, efficient, and productive to code together, as we were accustomed to from other projects, both gathered around a single computer in a room. This allowed for direct support and collaboration, especially on specific and more complicated tasks. This approach worked well, with everyone participating actively. Overall, I greatly enjoyed the collaboration and would be happy to work with my team member again in the future.

### Effect on me
This observation had a positive effect on me as it reinforced the importance of consistent and focused collaboration throughout the project duration. It reminded me of the value of clear communication and the benefits of working closely with team members (not only remote!) to overcome challenges effectively.

### Tip for the future 
To maintain consistency and productivity, it's essential not to slack off in the middle of the semester but to continue working steadily, as we did in the first and last thirds of this semester. Additionally, prioritizing regular in-person meetings or collaborative coding sessions can significantly enhance efficiency and save valuable time.

## Ali Ozeir - review 2

### My observation
I found the group work to be very pleasant. We functioned quite well as a team and were always able to exchange ideas. I believe we effectively divided our tasks and that everyone learned something during the project development. From my perspective, the project was a very enriching experience. Working virtually was less productive, so we decided to meet in person to collaborate on the project, which, in retrospect, worked very well. However, the workload towards the end was slightly larger than expected. This was due to the fact that we should have held fixed meetings in the mid the semester, despite the increased workload from other university courses and projects. Personally, I learned a lot through the project and am glad I chose this module. I'm proud that I was able to create the frontend using the WYSIWYG editor, despite having limited experience in HTML/CSS. I would be happy to collaborate on another project with my team anytime.

### Effect on me
This observation had a positive effect on me as it highlighted the benefits of early engagement in the project, leading to more time to implement functionalities and manage workload effectively. It also emphasized the importance of proactive communication and the value of acquiring new skills through practical experience.

### Tip for the future
To start working on the project earlier, as it allows for more time at the end to incorporate functionalities and manage workload more effectively. Additionally, scheduling regular progress review meetings throughout the project duration can help in identifying and addressing any challenges or deviations from the plan early on.
