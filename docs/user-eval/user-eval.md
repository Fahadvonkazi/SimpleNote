### Goal
To conduct a user evaluation or usability test, the project group developed a minimum viable product (MVP) to present to participants and gather their opinions and impressions of the proposed product. The first step in the user evaluation process was to create a sketch of the future website (see Appendix **???**) and use this sketch as the basis for the MVP. The sketch was created based on the previously mentioned goals and the value proposition. Following the creation of the sketch, the MVP was developed in VSC. Before the user evaluation could begin, the project group defined the goal. The project group determined that the following aspects of usability should be evaluated: navigation, design, and whether participants would use the website themselves.

### Method
The project group utilized Teams meetings with access control via Microsoft Teams to present the prototype to five individuals using a laptop provided by the project group. The five participants were carefully selected, as all of them regularly use note-taking apps and thus have a connection to the website and its idea. At the beginning of the test, all participants were informed about the website idea, followed by the task of navigating through the website via MS Teams access control. After navigating through all the web pages, the participants were asked questions regarding their experience with the website. All responses were recorded and evaluated in the next step (See Appendix B).

### Results
The evaluation of the participants revealed that the design of the website was perceived as very simple yet somewhat monotonous. However, the majority of participants liked the design. Regarding navigation, all participants agreed that it was effortless to navigate through the website. Furthermore, the presentation of information was perceived as clear and organized.

Participants were also asked if anything particularly positive or negative stood out to them. The following aspects were particularly positively noted by the participants: the simple and straightforward design and the name of the website. On the other hand, the participants identified the choice of colors as a negative aspect.

Additionally, all participants indicated that they would use the website themselves.

In conclusion, the user evaluation conducted by the project group proved to be highly beneficial. Both the project idea and the design of the prototype were positively received by the participants. While the feedback regarding the color design was acknowledged by the project group, it was not prioritized too highly, as the functionality of the website takes precedence.

On average, users required 2 minutes to complete the registration process, with a maximum of 5 minutes. The fact that there was a 0% drop-out rate suggests a positive user experience and a seamless registration process.

### Implications
Following the evaluation, we recognize the limitations encountered, such as the inability to sort pages within different books and limitations in text formatting, including the inability to add images into the text. Despite these challenges, the user evaluation proved to be a valuable method for testing and improving website usability.

Moving forward, we will prioritize maintaining intuitive navigation and enhancing the clarity of the information architecture. Additionally, we aim to improve the visual appeal of the application to enhance user engagement. We plan to conduct another evaluation once the application's development is complete to accurately assess the impact of these enhancements.
